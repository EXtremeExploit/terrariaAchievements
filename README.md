# Terraria Achievements Editor

# Site: [HERE](https://terrariaeditor.pedro.moe/)

* Terraria achievements file editor with tModLoader and Steam support

* This tool allows you to import your achievements.dat file (either the Steam version or tModLoader one) and edit the completion and progress of every achievement

* You can also later export this to a file either for Steam or tModLoader 
    * Mind you the Steam (Vanilla) version will "uncomplete" the achievements you dont have on steam, so using this tool to get achievements on the steam version alone is not possible
        * What you can do tho is install a mod in tModLoader that gives you the achievements from tMod to steam and export your achievements for tModLoader **(please PLEASE dont do this, keep the game's achievement distribution fair PLEASE)**

* **At the moment of writing this, tModLoader doesnt have custom achievements support**, and there isnt any mod that adds or edits achievements, but considering how achievements work, im confident that if work for it gets implemented and used, this tool will support them without any modification

* Important stuff:
    * https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/issues/1491 tModLoader custom achievements
    * https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/issues/3308 What this tool aims to implement
    * https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/issues/3318 Partially solves the issue of tMod achievements being out of sync with vanilla
